    <p>Science is fascinating. There’s a common misconception that science must be <em>made interesting</em> — that it must be dressed up in flashy clothes and simplified for people not on tenure to be interested in it. I believe that <strong>science speaks for itself,</strong> and that there are few things more wonderful than watching it in action and experimenting with it.</p>
<p>Look up at the Milky Way way at night: that’s science. Rockets, stinks <span class="amp">&amp;</span> bangs, this website, the internet — it’s all science. Even boring things like video games have science in them (there’s a lot of mathematics and physics involved in, say, Angry Birds). </p>
<p>That’s is what this alleged ‘Science Class’ thing is about: Building things with science, recreating discoveries that have been taken for granted (possibly even forgotten by most people) for hundreds or thousands of years, and having a good time in the process. It’s science without Comic Sans, bright colors, and affectation. (yeah, I have kind of a <em>thing</em> about <a href="http://comicsanscriminal.com">Comic Sans</a>.)</p>
<p>I attempt to take the middle road between simple and comprehensive. I don’t use large technical words unnecessarily, but I’m not writing in Simple English, either; if worst comes to worst, my more complicated ramblings can be thought of as vocabulary exercise. Also, I’m not attempting to explain the basic principles behind the projects in most cases. I would rather focus on what other sites don’t cover as well: neat and occasionally offbeat science projects that actually work. I usually link to resources that explain the principles involved more throughly — although note that it may take a Quantum Physicist to be able to <strong>accurately</strong> explain many of the fundamentals of science.</p>
<p>You may wonder, <em>What’s not boring about spinning puny little wires with electricity?</em> Everyone has their own reasons to learn about science, from practical to philosophic; but when it comes down to it, <strong>it’s usually about Curiosity.</strong> And since you’re on this website, you probably have a lion’s share of it.</p>
