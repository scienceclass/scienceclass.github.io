Summary: Science is fascinating. There’s a common misconception that science must be &lt;em&gt;made interesting&lt;/em&gt; — that it must be dressed up in flashy clothes and simplified for people not on tenure to be interested in it, to make it ‘cool’. I believe that &lt;strong&gt;science speaks for itself,&lt;/strong&gt; and that there are few things more wonderful than watching it in action and experimenting with it …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science is fascinating. There’s a common misconception that science must be &lt;em&gt;made interesting&lt;/em&gt; — that it must be dressed up in flashy clothes and simplified for people not on tenure to be interested in it. I believe that &lt;strong&gt;science speaks for itself,&lt;/strong&gt; and that there are few things more wonderful than watching it in action and experimenting with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up at the Milky Way way at night: that’s science. Rockets, stinks &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; bangs, this website, the internet — it’s all science. Even boring things like video games have science in them (there’s a lot of mathematics and physics involved in, say, Angry Birds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s is what this alleged ‘Science Class’ thing is about: Building things with science, recreating discoveries that have been taken for granted (possibly even forgotten by most people) for hundreds or thousands of years, and having a good time in the process. It’s science without Comic Sans, bright colors, and affectation. (yeah, I have kind of a &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; about &lt;a href="http://comicsanscriminal.com"&gt;Comic Sans&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attempt to take the middle road between simple and comprehensive. I don’t use large technical words unnecessarily, but I’m not writing in Simple English, either; if worst comes to worst, my more complicated ramblings can be thought of as vocabulary exercise. Also, I’m not attempting to explain the basic principles behind the projects in most cases. I would rather focus on what other sites don’t cover as well: neat and occasionally offbeat science projects that actually work. I usually link to resources that explain the principles involved more throughly — although note that it may take a Quantum Physicist to be able to &lt;strong&gt;accurately&lt;/strong&gt; explain many of the fundamentals of science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may wonder, &lt;em&gt;What’s not boring about spinning puny little wires with electricity?&lt;/em&gt; Everyone has their own reasons to learn about science, from practical to philosophic; but when it comes down to it, &lt;strong&gt;it’s usually about Curiosity.&lt;/strong&gt; And since you’re on this website, you probably have a lion’s share of it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
