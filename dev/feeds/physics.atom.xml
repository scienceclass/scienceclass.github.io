&lt;p&gt;These days, when you go somewhere, you probably don’t get lost too often. Whether sailing around the world or looking for the nearest Thrifties in a new town, modern man does not need to engage many brain cells — instead, he draws his smartphone, GPS, or computer, and lets those do the hard work. When you go somewhere, chances are you rely on the Global Positioning System, or GPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global positioning system is a network of satellites orbiting earth, maintained by the US government (other countries have similar systems, but GPS is the most widespread), that provide location and time information to anyone with a GPS receiver. How this works is your GPS receiver connects to four satellites, which are continuously transmitting their location and the time each message is transmitted. The receiver then calculates its position (with the help of some complicated  &lt;a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gps#Navigational_Eqations"&gt;navigational equations&lt;/a&gt;) based the transit time of the signals from the satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably use it all the time, but the GPS system is, quite frankly, rather complicated, and you can’t bet on always being able to rely on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if you were lost with nothing but a rough map and your pocket cheese? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would need a Compass — a device people have used for navigation since 1040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compass we originally invented as a device for &lt;a href="http://wikipedia/wiki/divinationn"&gt;Divinationn&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese Han Dynasty (about 206 BC), but was not used for navigation until 1040.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bill of Materials&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A STRONG MAGNET&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I would recommend a Neodymium or ‘Rare Earth’ magnet, because of thier strength, but any strong magnet will work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NEEDLE&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;This will form a the literal ‘Compass Needle’. It doesn’t have to be a needle — you can use any needle-like piece of iron.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
